<h2>OLED Display<h2/>
<h4>
<br>The OledDiplay.py code shows how to interface the OLED display to the Raspberry Pi Pico.<br/>
<br>`I used the ssd1306 and oled libraries. This also helped in manipulating and changing the text fonts on the display<br/>
<br><br/>

<h2>Reading From Analog Sensors<h2/>
<h4>
<br>A potentiometer is used here. As the knob is rotated, the values displayed on the Oled varies.<br/>
<br>This can be used in control purposes such as controlling the brightness of an LED, speed of motor etc<br/>
<br>The python file for this is the Potentiometer_Read.py file <br/>
